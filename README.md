# GNC Tools
If you are interested in Guidance, Navigation, Control, Signal Processing, Modelling or Software Development for Aerospace Applications, use MATLAB and know your way around C/C++, then GNC Tools provides a suite of example software and models for free! See the [GNC Tools Wiki](https://controlengineering.co.nz/Wikis/GNC/) for details on everything GNC!

#### Downloading GNC Tools
The best way to get GNCTools is to clone the master branch from GitHub (this page!) using git. I like [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) which makes it easy to use git without the command line. Once you have git/GitKraken/some other git client, simply click **Clone or download** (above, green button) and copy the address of this repository, and clone it to your computer. This way each time I push updates to the master branch, you can simply pull them down without having to redownload the entire package again! 

If you don't use git, and don't want to learn (remember its easy and you should use it!), simply click **Clone or download** and click **Download ZIP** and save GNCTools somewhere you can find it.

#### Installing GNC Tools
Once you have cloned or downloaded GNCTools to your PC, simply open MATLAB and navigate in MATLAB to the directory where you have placed GNCTools (hopefully somewhere permanent). Right click on `GNCTools_Install.m` and click Run. Follow the prompts (Yes 'Y' is the normal response to every question) to install GNCTools - easy!

#### Using GNC Tools
The best way to start using GNCTools is to have a look at the [Wiki](https://www.controlengineering.co.nz/Wikis/GNC/pmwiki.php). There are lots of problem and code examples (which all work) as well as helpful definitions.
